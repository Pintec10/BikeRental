GENERAL DESCRIPTION

This is a backend application for a bike rental store with two types of bikes (3 normal bikes and 2 mountain bikes). 

The rental price is 10€/day for normal bikes and 12€/day for mountain bikes. The application allows to:

⦁	rent a bike from a specified date and for a specified number of days; payment is made upfront

⦁	return the bike and calculate the final cost. If a bike is returned late, a surcharge of 3€ is applied for each extra day if the bike is returned late.

The app was designed with extensibility criteria in mind: if in the future additional features are required such as changing the amount of bikes, introducing new bike types or changing the prices, this could be done without extensive rewriting of existing code, but rather extending it.
